OSCATS: Open-Source Computerized Adaptive Testing System
Programming Library Examples
----------------------------

The programs in this directory provide examples of how to program with
OSCATS in C and the languages with bindings provided.

To compile the C examples, simply run "make" in this directory, or:
  gcc -o ex01 ex01.c -I../src/liboscats -L../src/liboscats/.libs -loscats \
    `pkg-config --cflags --libs gobject-2.0` \
    `gsl-config --cflags --libs`

To run the python examples, you may need to set:
  PYTHONPATH=../bindings/python/.libs

Note that the php_oscats.so library must be installed in $PHP_EXTENSIONS_DIR
in order to run the php examples.

To compile and run the java examples:
  javac -cp ../bindings/java/glib.jar:../bindings/java/oscats.jar ex01.java
  java -cp .:../bindings/java/glib.jar:../bindings/java/oscats.jar \
    -Djava.library.path=../bindings/java/.libs ex01

Note: On Windows, the colons in the the classpath should be semi-colons.

- Example 1: Comparison of random and matched item selection
  Model: 1D 1PL
  Compare quality of estimated ability and item exposure under four
  different item selection criteria.
